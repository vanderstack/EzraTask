# 1. Choice of Vue.js for Frontend Framework

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Date:** 2025-11-4

## Context

The take-home assessment explicitly allows for the use of either React or Vue for the frontend application. The target job description for the role at Ezra lists Vue.js as a key part of their technology stack. The goal
 is to select a framework that not only fulfills the assessment's requirements but also demonstrates alignment with the company's existing technical ecosystem.

## Decision

We will use **Vue.js** (version 3 with the Composition API) as the frontend framework for this project.

## Consequences

### Positive:

*   **Direct Skill Alignment:** Demonstrates proficiency in the exact framework used by the target team, making the project a more relevant showcase of applicable skills.
*   **Excellent Developer Experience:** Vue's single-file components, clear separation of concerns, and well-designed Composition API provide a highly productive development environment.
*   **Strong Ecosystem:** The Vue ecosystem, including tools like Vite for builds and Vitest for testing, is modern, fast, and well-supported.
*   **Fulfills Requirements:** Directly satisfies one of the two acceptable options outlined in the assessment prompt.

### Negative:

*   **None:** Given that Vue is explicitly allowed and is the preferred framework for the role, there are no significant downsides to this choice.
