# Contributing to EzraTask

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EzraTask! This document outlines our development process and guidelines.

## Development Workflow

We use a feature-branch workflow with pull requests to the `main` branch.

1.  **Create a Branch:** Start by creating a new branch for your feature or bug fix from the `main` branch.
2.  **Develop:** Make your code changes, following the existing patterns and conventions.
3.  **Test:** Run all local tests and E2e tests to ensure your changes haven't introduced regressions.
4.  **Open a Pull Request:** When your changes are ready, open a pull request against the `main` branch.
